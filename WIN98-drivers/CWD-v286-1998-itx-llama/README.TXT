    3.	Again, Windows95 will request that you provide the Crystal 
	SoundFusion(tm) Disk.  Press the OK button to continue, then 
	provide the path to the location of the driver files.


    WINDOWS 98

    1.  Windows will detect the PCI Multimedia Audio Device and initiate the 
        Add New Hardware Wizard.  Press the NEXT button to continue.

    2.  Select the 'Search for the best driver for your device' option and press

========================================================================

   
    1. 	From the Windows START menu, run SETUP.EXE located in the Crystal 
        SoundFusion(tm) CD (or the appropriate path to the location of 
        the driver files) and select Install or Uninstall.  This application 
        will do an automatic clean-up of the Windows 95 Crystal Audio registry 
        entries.  
        
        NOTE: Many problems with reinstallation occur because of existing 
        registry entries from previous installations and because of the 
        \WINDOWS\INF\OEMx.INF files.  After running SETUP.EXE, the various 
        Crystal devices should not be listed in the Device Manager window.  

    2. 	Restart your system.  If you want to remove or install any hardware, 
	select the SHUTDOWN option and turn off your PC.

    3.	Turn PC on.  Upon loading, Windows 95 will detect new hardware, create 
	an information database, and proceed with the installation of Crystal 
	device drivers (as described in the previous section)
